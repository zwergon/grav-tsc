# Agency Skeleton for Grav

This Grav skeleton is based around the [Agency Grav theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-agency) which in turn, is a port of the [Jekyll Agency theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme) by [Rick Kim (y7kim)](https://github.com/y7kim), which originated from the [Agency Bootstrap theme by Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/).

## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [Agency theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-agency)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the Agency Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install agency
```
